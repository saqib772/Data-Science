# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects people with diabetes and can lead to permanent blindness if not treated promptly. This repository presents a novel and efficient method for diagnosing retinopathy from retinal fundus images using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

In addition, we have also explored deep learning-based solutions with Grad-CAM scores to highlight the areas of interest from the model's point of view.

This project was selected for the Google AI ML Mentorship Bootcamp, making it one of the 20 projects chosen from all over India. We are proud to share our work with the community and hope that it contributes to the advancement of diabetic retinopathy detection techniques.

## Features
* SVM and KNN algorithms for diabetic retinopathy detection
* Deep learning-based solutions with Grad-CAM scores
* Retinal fundus image processing
* Evaluation metrics for model performance
* Detailed documentation and code comments for easy understanding and reproducibility

## Installation
To use this repository, please follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
``` git clone https://github.com/your_username/Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection.git```
Change to the repository directory:
```  cd Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection```

Install the required dependencies using pip:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Usage

## SVM and KNN Algorithms
1. Prepare your retinal fundus images for processing.

2. Run the SVM or KNN scripts, depending on your choice of algorithm:
``` python svm.py ``` or ```python knn.py```
# Deep Learning-based Solutions with Grad-CAM Scores
1. Prepare your retinal fundus images for processing.
2. Run the deep learning script: ```python deep_learning.py```
This script will train the deep learning model and generate predictions for the retinal fundus images. It will also generate Grad-CAM scores to highlight the areas of interest from the model's point of view.

## Evaluation

We have included evaluation metrics in the respective scripts for SVM, KNN, and deep learning-based solutions to assess the performance of the models. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
